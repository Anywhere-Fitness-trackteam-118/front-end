### MVP Requirements

* [X] React app is deployed and the static landing page is correctly incorporated with the app
* [ ] CRUD operations drive the application. Each participating student individually created pages that complete all CRUD operations. Token authentication is handled correctly 
* [ ] Student has implemented state management systems that makes sense for the project. It is organized well and implemented correctly. State is not lost as user goes through the application. 
* [ ] Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built
* [ ] Team member was collaborative, able to work in a team environment

### Stretch Goals

* [ ] App is deployed, and continuous deployment is set up in a manner that is conducive to a team project environment. Project is organized well on GitHub. Extra considerations were made to help all team members understand how to contribute easily to the project, no matter their role.
* [ ] Pages making HTTP requests do so in a logical manner that is cohesive with the app's state management system. Student showed great care and insight when handling token authentication. Student used a modular system for all requests (e.g. like a  useFetch custom hook).
* [ ] Student showed the ability to manage state in a very coherent system at all levels of the app - global state management, component tree state management, and individual component management. The system is easy to understand and use. Student may have also architected it in such a way that it is reusable for a lot of the state management needs of the app.
* [ ] Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built and the student went above and beyond the project.
* [ ] Pair programmed with the Web UI and Back end Architect

### Tech

Anywhere Fitness uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Axios]( https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) - Reactstrap provides prebuilt Bootstrap 4 components that allow a great deal of flexibility and prebuilt validation
* [Redux-Logger](https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger) -  Redux logging tool that lets you replay problems as if they happened in your own browser. 
* [Styled-Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) - Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress
